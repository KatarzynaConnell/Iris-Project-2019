# About the dataset

Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher, byname R.A. Fisher, (born February 17, 1890, London, Englandâ€”died July 29, 1962, Adelaide, Australia) was British statistician and geneticist who pioneered the application of statistical procedures to the design of scientific experiments.

In 1936 he introduced the Iris flower data set (aka Fisher's Iris data set) which is a multivariate data set that consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris:
1 Iris setosa
2 Iris virginica 
3 Iris versicolor

 Four features were measured from each sample: 
1 the length of the sepals, in centimeters
2 the length of the petals, in centimeters
3 the width of the sepals, in centimeters 
4 the width of the petals, in centimeters

Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.
