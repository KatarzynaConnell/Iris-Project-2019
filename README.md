1. Sir Ronal Fisher and Iris dataset - brief introduction

Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher, byname R.A. Fisher, (born February 17, 1890, London, England—died July 29, 1962, Adelaide, Australia) was British statistician and geneticist who pioneered the application of statistical procedures to the design of scientific experiments.

In 1936 he introduced the Iris flower data set (aka Fisher's Iris data set) which is a multivariate data set that consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris:
Iris setosa, Iris virginica, Iris versicolor.

Four features were measured (in cm) from each sample: 
the length of the sepals, the length of the petals
the width of the sepals, the width of the petals

Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other. 

It is worth noting that dataset is sometimes called Anderson’s Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. Two of the three species were collected in the Gaspé Peninsula “all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus”

2. Presentation of the dataset
The data set contains 150 observations of iris flowers. There are four columns of measurements of the flowers in centimeters. The fifth column is the species of the flower observed. All observed flowers belong to one of three species.


3. Statistical figures: columns and species
The statistical summary figures for each column are:


The Mean, Maximum and Minimum value for each of the species are:
